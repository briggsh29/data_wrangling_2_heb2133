#Strings and factors

Strings from course website (vectors)

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

#detect a partic pattern
str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")

str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff")

string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )
#being specific - beginngin of line
str_detect(string_vec, "^i think")
#Ending with
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$")

string_vec1 = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

#Using regular expression; saying you can start with either B or b
str_detect(string_vec1,"[Bb]ush")

string_vec2 = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )
#what if I want a number immed followed by letter
str_detect(string_vec2, "[0-9][a-zA-Z]")

string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )
#dot is special character in regular expressions that will match anything
str_detect(string_vec, "7.11")

#if I want it to interpret as literal dot
str_detect(string_vec, "7\\.11")

string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )
#want to detect an open bracket; slash is also special character, need \\
str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
```

#Factors 

```{r}
fac_vec = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))

#Gives us levels (we have not told it level order, assuming alphabetical)
fac_vec

as.numeric(c(fac_vec))
```

What happens if I relevel some of these

```{r}
fac_vec = fct_relevel(fac_vec, "male")

fac_vec

as.numeric(c(fac_vec))
#male now corresponds to 1 and female to 2
```
